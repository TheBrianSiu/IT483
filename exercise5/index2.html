    <h1>Welcome to my site.<br>Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
<pre>
I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite 
holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.

If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween 
pictures, stories,and films. And if you join my email list,I will keep
you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
