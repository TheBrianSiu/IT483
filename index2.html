    <h1>Welcome to my site.Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
<pre>
I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during 
the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become&nbsp;
quite a hit.

If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories,
and films. And if you join my email list,I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
